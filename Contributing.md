## Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search [issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new! This helps avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes any kind of contribution! Here are a few suggestions:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Code**: help maintain and improve the project codebase.
